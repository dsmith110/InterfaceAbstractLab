         * many more methods and put in algorithms based on character 
         * interaction, combat,inventory management, etc. I didn't realize how 
         * in depth programming a video game can be. I feel I've shown an 
         * understanding of inheritance the correct way with abstract classes 
         * and interfaces, but there is always room for improvement, such as 
         * creating an Object super class that character, weapon, and prop can 
         * inherit from. That way you could use Liskov substitution to make all 
         * these objects interact with each other. I could also add Mage, Rogue,
         * Orc,or Goblin interfaces, so there is more variety of character types.
